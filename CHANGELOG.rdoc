== 0.2.9 (Nov, 21, 2010)

Changes:
  - Renamed Toucher to Pinger (it was confusing with the "touch" command used to restart Passenger)
  - Renamed :touch option to :ping, can only be true or false (false by default)
  - Ping localhost in a new thread in order not to block other guards execution, only display information/error message on the current state of localhost
