      watch('config/.*\.rb')
    end

=== Passenger standalone

Passenger standalone is used as default. You can pass options to the guard to disable or configure it. Guard::Passenger will start passenger on startup and take it down on exit.
By default passenger standalone is activated and port is set to 3000.

=== Touching

If touching is enabled Guard::Passenger will open the given path. By default it requests http://localhost:3000/ and checks if the http status is alright.

=== Guard options

Guard::Passenger accepts some options for configuration.

    # :standalone    boolean     run passenger standalone                     (default: true)
    # :port          integer     using the given port                         (default: 3000)
    # :env           string      framework environment                        (default: development)
    # :touch         string      path to check if restart was successful      (default: /)            (false = off)
